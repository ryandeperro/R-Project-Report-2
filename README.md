# R-Project-Report-2


User Data:

Open the file and print the column names.
Use Pearson r correlation to evaluate the relationship between cool_votes, funny_votes, and useful_votes.
Do a linear regression analysis of 2 of the 3 columns from the last step, including finding the equation of a fit line and plotting/labeling it.
Does writing reviews (i.e. review_count) bring a user more fans? Support your answer using linear regression techniques.
Find a different variable (besides review_count) that would bring a user more fans. Again, support your answer using quantitative techniques.
Use the kmeans machine learning algorithm to see if you can organize the data into usable clusters. Do this first for review_count and fans, and then for the different variables that you chose in the previous part. Hoe many clusters did you choose? Why? Be sure to provide a justification/interpretation.
